\title{Get mutations at CpG sites}
\usage{
get_CpG_mutations(regions, mut_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{regions}{A GRanges object containing the genomic regions of interest in which to look for CpG sites. Must have the metadata column "sequence" populated with the raw nucleotide sequence to search for CpGs.}

\item{mut_data}{A GRanges object containing the mutation data to be interrogated.}
}
\value{
A GRanges object where each range is a mutation at a CpG site (a subset of mutations from the larger object provided to the function).
}
\description{
Subset the mutations provided and return only mutations that are found at CpG sites.
