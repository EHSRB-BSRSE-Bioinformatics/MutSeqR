\title{Get mutations at CpG sites}
\usage{
get_CpG_mutations(
  regions,
  mut_data,
  variant_types = c("snv", "insertion", "deletion", "mnv", "symbolic"),
  include_no_variants = TRUE,
  motif = "CG"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{regions}{A GRanges object containing the genomic regions of interest
in which to look for CpG sites. Must have the metadata column "sequence"
populated with the raw nucleotide sequence to search for CpGs. This object can be
obtained using the get_seq.R function.}

\item{mut_data}{A dataframe or GRanges object containing the mutation data to
be interrogated.}

\item{variant_types}{Include these variant types. A vector of one or more
"snv", "complex", "deletion", "insertion", "mnv", "symbolic", "no_variant".
Default includes all variants.}

\item{include_no_variants}{TRUE or FALSE to indicate whether the table should
include CpG sites with no variants. Useful if you want to know how many of
the potential sites were mutated.}

\item{motif}{Default "CG", which returns CpG sites. You could in theory use
an arbitrary string to look at different motifs. Use with caution.}
}
\value{
A GRanges object where each range is a mutation at a CpG site
(a subset of mutations from the larger object provided to the function).
}
\description{
Subset the mutation data provided and return only mutations that are found
at CpG sites.
