  sample_col = "sample",
  response_col = "proportion_unique",

\arguments{
\item{mf_data}{A data frame containing the mutation data. This data must
include a column containing the mutation subtypes, a column containing
the sample/cohort names, and a column containing the response variable.
Typical response variables can be the subtype frequency, proportion, or
count.}

\item{sample_col}{The name of the column in data that contains the
sample/cohort names.}

\item{response_col}{The name of the column in data that contains the
response variable. Typical response variables can be the subtype frequency,
proportion, or count.}

\item{subtype_col}{The name of the column in data that contains the
mutation subtypes.}

\item{sample_order}{The method for ordering the samples within the plot.
Options include:
\itemize{
\item \code{none}: No ordering is performed. Default.
\item \code{smart}: Samples are ordered based on the sample names.
\item \code{arranged}: Samples are ordered based on one or more factor column(s)
in mf_data. Column names are passed to the function using the
\code{sample_order_input}.
\item \code{custom}: Samples are ordered based on a custom vector of sample
names. The custom vector is passed to the function using the
\code{sample_order_input}.
\item \code{clustered}: Samples are ordered based on hierarchical clustering. The
dissimilarity matrix can be specified using the \code{dist} argument. The
agglomeration method can be specified using the \code{cluster_method} argument.
}}

\item{sample_order_input}{A character vector specifying details for the
sample order method. If \code{sample_order} is \code{arranged}, \code{sample_order_input}
should contain the column name(s) to be used for ordering the samples. If
\code{sample_order} is \code{custom}, \code{sample_order_input} should contain the custom
vector of sample names.}

\item{dist}{The dissimilarity matrix for hierarchical clustering. Options
are \code{cosine}, \code{euclidean}, \code{maximum}, \code{manhattan}, \code{canberra}, \code{binary} or
\code{minkowski}. The default is \code{cosine}. See \link[stats]{dist} for details.}

\item{cluster_method}{The agglomeration method for hierarchical clustering.
Options are \code{ward.D}, \code{ward.D2}, \code{single}, \code{complete}, \code{average} (= UPGMA),
\code{mcquitty} (= WPGMA), \code{median} (= WPGMC) or \code{centroid} (= UPGMC). The default
is \code{Ward.D}. See \link[stats]{hclust} for details.}

\item{palette}{A named vector of colors to be used for the mutation subtypes.
The names of the vector should correspond to the mutation subtypes in the
data. The default is a set of colors from the RColorBrewer package.}
}
\description{
Given a data frame construct a plot displaying the
mutation subtypes observed in a cohort.
