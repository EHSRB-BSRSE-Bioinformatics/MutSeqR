\arguments{
\item{mf_data}{A data frame containing the mutation data. This data must
include a column containing the mutation subtypes, a column containing
the sample/cohort names, and a column containing the response variable.
Typical response variables can be the subtype frequency, proportion, or
count.}

\item{sample_col}{The name of the column in data that contains the
sample/cohort names.}

\item{response_col}{The name of the column in data that contains the
response variable. Typical response variables can be the subtype frequency,
proportion, or count.}

\item{subtype_col}{The name of the column in data that contains the
mutation subtypes.}

\item{sample_order}{The method for ordering the samples within the plot.
Options include:}
}
\description{
Given a data frame construct a plot displaying the
mutation subtypes observed in a cohort.
