\arguments{
\item{mut_file}{"filepath". The .mut file containing mutation
data to be imported. This can be either a data frame object or a filepath
to a file or directory. If you specify a folder, the function will
attempt to read all files in the folder and combine them into
a single data frame. Required columns are listed below.
Synonymous names for these columns are accepted.
\itemize{
\item \code{contig}: The reference sequence name.
\item \code{start}: 0-based start position of the feature in contig.
\item \code{end}: half-open end position of the feature in contig.
\item \code{sample}: The sample name.
\item \code{ref}: The reference allele at this position
\item \code{alt}: The left-aligned, normalized, alternate allele at this
position.
}
The following columns are not required, but are recommended for full
package functionality:
\itemize{
\item \code{alt_depth}: The read depth supporting the alternate allele. If
not included, the function will assume a value of 1.
\item depth col: The total read depth at this position. This column can
be \code{total_depth} (excluding N-calls) or \code{depth}(including N-calls; if
\code{total_depth} is not available.
}}

\item{mut_sep}{The delimiter for importing the .mut file.
Default is tab-delimited.}

\item{is_0_based_mut}{A logical variable. Indicates whether the
position coordinates in the mutation data are 0 based (TRUE) or
1 based (FALSE). If TRUE, positions will be converted to 1-based.}

\item{sample_data_file}{"filepath". A file containing
\code{custom_regions_file} target region coordinates are 0 based (TRUE)
or 1 based (FALSE). If TRUE, ranges will be converted to 1-based.
additional sample metadata (dose, tissue, timepoint, etc.).
This can be either a data frame object or a file path to a file.}

\item{sd_sep}{The delimiter for importing sample metadata table.
Default is tab-delimited.}

\item{regions}{Values are \verb{c("TSpanel_human", "TSpanel_mouse", "TSpanel_rat" "custom_interval", "none")}.
Indicates the target panel used for Duplex Sequencing.
The argument refers to the TS Mutagenesis panel of the
specified species, or to a custom panel. If "custom",
provide the file path of your regions file in
\code{custom_regions_file}.}

\item{custom_regions_file}{"filepath". If \code{regions} is set to
"custom_interval", provide  the file containing regions metadata.
Required columns are \code{contig}, \code{start}, and \code{end}. This can be either
a data frame object or a file path to a file.}

\item{rg_sep}{The delimiter for importing the \code{custom_regions_file}.
Default is tab-delimited.}

\item{is_0_based_rg}{A logical variable. Indicates whether the
position coordinates in the custom regions file are 0 based (TRUE) or
1 based (FALSE). If TRUE, positions will be converted to 1-based.}

\item{range_buffer}{An integer >= 0. Extend the range of your regions
in both directions by the given amount. Ex. Structural variants and
indels may start outside of the regions. Adjust the range_buffer to
include these variants in your regions.}

\item{genome}{The genome assembly of the reference genome. This is only
required if your data does not include a context column. Sequences will
be retrieved for the given reference genome to populate the context column.
For a complete list, refer to https://genome.ucsc.edu.
Ex.Human GRCh38 = hg38 | Human GRCh37 = hg19 | Mouse GRCm38 = mm10 |
Mouse GRCm39 = mm39 | Rat RGSC 6.0 = rn6 | Rat mRatBN7.2 = rn7}

\item{species}{The species of your data. Required if
your data does not include a context column and regions = "none". The
function will install a BS genome for the given species/genome/masked to
populate the context column. The species can be the common name of the
species or the scientific name. Ex. "human" or "Homo sapiens".}

\item{masked_BS_genome}{A logical value. Required when using a BS genome
to poulate the context column. Whether to use the masked version of the
BS genome (TRUE) or not (FALSE).}

\item{depth_calc}{Values are \code{c("take_del", "take_mean")}. In the instance
when there are two or more calls at the same location within a sample, and
the depths differ, this parameter chooses the method for resolving the
difference. This occurs when a deletion is called in the data. It will be
called alongside a no_variant. "take_mean" calculates the depth column by
taking the mean of all depths in the group. "take_del" calculates the depth
column by choosing only the depth of the deletion in the group, or if no
deletion is present, the complex variant. If there is no deletion or
complex variant, then it takes the mean of the depths within the group.
Default is "take_del". depth_col = \code{total_depth} or \code{depth}.}

\item{custom_column_names}{A list of names to specify the meaning of column
headers. Since column names can vary with data, this might be necessary to
digest the mutation data table properly. Typical defaults are set, but can
be substituted in the form of \code{list(total_depth = "my_custom_depth_name", sample = "my_custom_sample_column_name")}. For a comprehensive list, see
examples. You can change one or more of these.}

\item{output_granges}{A logical variable; whether you want the mutation
data to output as a GRanges object. Default output (FALSE) is as a dataframe.}

\item{vaf_cutoff}{The function will add \code{is_germline} column
that identifies ostensibly germline variants using a cutoff
for variant allele fraction (VAF). There is no default value
provided, but generally a value of 0.1 (i.e., 10\%) is a good
starting point. Setting this will flag variants that are
present at a frequency greater than this value at a given site.}
}
\value{
A table where each row is a mutation, and columns indicate the
location, type, and other data. If \code{output_granges} is set to TRUE, the
mutation data will be returned as a GRanges object, otherwise mutation
data is returned as a dataframe.

Output Column Definitions:
\itemize{
\item \code{nchar_ref}: The length (in bp) of the reference allele.
\item \code{nchar_alt}: The length (in bp) of the alternate allele.
\item \code{varlen}: The length (in bp) of the variant.
\item \code{total_depth}: The total read depth at this position, excluding
N-calls.
\item \code{vaf}: The variant allele fraction. Calculated as
\code{alt_depth}/\code{depth_col} where \code{depth_col} can be \code{total_depth} or \code{depth}.
\item \code{is_germline}: TRUE or FALSE. Flags ostensible germline mutations
(\code{vaf} > \code{vaf_cutoff}).
\item \code{ref_depth}: The total read depth at the position calling for the

(12-base spectrum; e.g. A>C)
\item \code{short_ref}: The reference base at this position.
\item \code{normalized_subtype}: The C/T-based substitution type for the
snv variant (6-base spectrum; e.g. A>C -> T>G).
\item \code{normalized_ref}: The reference base in C/T-base notation for
this position (e.g. A -> T).
\item \code{context_with_mutation}: The substitution type fo the snv variant
including the two flanking nucleotides (192-trinucleotide spectrum;
e.g. \verb{T[A>C]G})

type for the snv variant including the two flanking nucleotide
(96-base spectrum e.g. \verb{T[A>C]G} -> \verb{C[T>G]A})
\item \code{normalized_context}: The trinucleotide context in C/T base
notation for this position (e.g. TAG -> CTA).

\item \code{row_has_duplicate}: TRUE or FALSE. Flags rows whose position is
