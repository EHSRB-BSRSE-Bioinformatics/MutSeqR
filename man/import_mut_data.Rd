\arguments{
\item{mut_file}{"filepath". The .mut file containing mutation data to be imported. If you
specify a folder, the function will attempt to read all files in the folder and
combine them into a single data frame.
Required columns are listed below. Synonymous names for these columns are accepted.
\itemize{
\item \code{contig}: The reference sequence name.
\item \code{start}: 0-based start position of the feature in contig.
\item \code{end}: half-open end position of the feature in contig.
\item \code{sample}: The sample name.
\item \code{ref}: The reference allele at this position
\item \code{alt}: The left-aligned, normalized, alternate allele at this position.
\item \code{alt_depth}: The read depth supporting the alternate allele.
\item depth col: The total read depth at this position. This column can be
\code{total_depth} (excluding N-calls) or \code{depth} (including N-calls; if \code{total_depth}
is not available).
\item \code{variation_type}: The category to which this variant is assigned.
\item \code{context}: The local reference trinucleotide context at this position (e.g. ATC - not
necessarily the transcript codon)
}}

\item{mut_sep}{The delimiter for importing the .mut file. Default is tab-delimited.}

\item{rsids}{\code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}; whether or not the .mut file contains rsID information
(existing SNPs).}

\item{sample_data_file}{"filepath". An optional file containing additional sample metadata
(dose, tissue, timepoint, etc.).}

\item{sd_sep}{The delimiter for importing sample metadata table. Default is tab-delimited.}

\item{vaf_cutoff}{The function will add \code{is_germline} column that identifies ostensibly germline variants using
a cutoff for variant allele fraction (VAF). There is no default value provided,
but generally a value of 0.1 (i.e., 10\%) is a good starting point. Setting this will
flag variants that are present at a frequency greater than this value
at a given site.}

\item{range_buffer}{An integer >= 0. Variants that occur outside of the
defined regions' ranges will be filtered out. Use the range-buffer to extend
the range within which a variant can occur. The default is 1 nucleotide
outside of region ranges. Ex. Structural variants and indels may start outside
of the regions. Adjust the range_buffer to include these variants.}

\item{regions}{Values are \code{c("human", "mouse", "custom")}. Indicates the target panel used for Duplex Sequencing.
The argument refers to the TS Mutagenesis panel of the specified species, or to a custom panel.
If "custom", provide the file path of your regions file in \code{custom_regions_file}. TO DO: add rat.}

\item{custom_regions_file}{"filepath". If \code{regions} is set to "custom",
provide the file path for the file containing regions metadata.
Required columns are \code{contig}, \code{start}, and \code{end}.}

\item{rg_sep}{The delimiter for importing the \code{custom_regions_file}.
Default is tab-delimited.}

\item{is_0_based}{Indicates whether the \code{custom_regions_file} target region coordinates are
0 based (TRUE) or 1 based (FALSE). If TRUE, ranges will be converted to 1-based.}

\item{depth_calc}{Values are \code{c("take_del", "take_mean")}. In the instance when
there are two or more calls at the same location within a sample, and the
depths differ, this parameter chooses the method for resolving the difference.
This occurs when a deletion is called in the data. It will be called alongside a no_variant.
"take_mean" calculates the depth column by taking the mean of all depths in the group.
"take_del" calculates the depth column by choosing only the depth of
the deletion in the group, or if no deletion is present, the complex variant.
If there is no deletion or complex variant, then it takes the mean of the
depths within the group. Default is "take_del". depth_col = \code{total_depth} or \code{depth}.}

\item{custom_column_names}{A list of names to specify the meaning of column
headers. Since column names can vary with data, this might be necessary to
digest the mutation data table properly. Typical defaults are set, but can
be substituted in the form of \code{list(total_depth = "my_custom_depth_name",  sample = "my_custom_sample_column_name")}. For a comprehensive list, see
examples. You can change one or more of these.}

\item{output_granges}{\code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}; whether you want the mutation data to
output as a GRanges object. Default output is as a dataframe.}
}
\value{
A table where each row is a mutation, and columns indicate the location, type, and other data.
Output Column Definitions:
\itemize{
\item \code{nchar_ref}: The length (in bp) of the reference allele.
\item \code{nchar_alt}: The length (in bp) of the alternate allele.
\item \code{varlen}: The length (in bp) of the variant.
\item \code{total_depth}: The total read depth at this position, excluding N-calls.
\item \code{vaf}: The variant allele fraction. Calculated as \code{alt_depth}/\code{depth_col}
where \code{depth_col} can be \code{total_depth} or \code{depth}.
\item \code{is_germline}: TRUE or FALSE. Flags ostensible germline mutations (\code{vaf} > \code{vaf_cutoff}).
\item \code{ref_depth}: The total read depth at the position calling for the reference allele.
Calculated as \code{depth_col} - \code{alt_depth} where \code{depth_col} can be \code{total_depth} or \code{depth}.
\item \code{subtype}: The substitution type for the snv variant (12-base spectrum; e.g. A>C)
\item \code{short_ref}: The reference base at this position.
\item \code{normalized_subtype}: The C/T-based substitution type for the snv variant
(6-base spectrum; e.g. A>C -> T>G)
\item \code{normalized_ref}: The reference base in C/T-base notation for this position
(e.g. A -> T).
\item \code{context_with_mutation}: The substitution type fo the snv variant including
the two flanking nucleotides (192-trinucleotide spectrum; e.g. \verb{T[A>C]G})
\item \code{normalized_context_with_mutation}: The C/T-based substitution type for the
snv variant including the two flanking nucleotides (96-base spectrum e.g. \verb{T[A>C]G} -> \verb{C[T>G]A})
\item \code{normalized_context}: The trinucleotide context in C/T base notation for this
position (e.g. TAG -> CTA).
\item \code{gc_content}: \% GC of the trinucleotide context at this position.
