\arguments{
\item{mut_file}{The .mut file containing mutation data to be imported. If you
specify a folder, function will attempt to read all files in the folder and
combine them into a single data frame.
Columns required are: depth col = (depth & no_calls or total_depth),
alt_depth, context, ref, variation_type, contig, start
(Synonymous names are accepted)}

\item{rsids}{TRUE or FALSE; whether or not the .mut file contains rsID information
(existing SNPs)}

\item{sample_data_file}{An optional file containing additional sample metadata
(dose, timepoint, etc.)}

\item{sd_sep}{The delimiter for importing sample metadata tables}

\item{mut_sep}{The delimiter for importing the .mut file}

\item{vaf_cutoff}{Add a column to identify ostensibly germline variants using
a cutoff for variant allele fraction (VAF). There is no default value provided,
but generally a value of 0.1 (i.e., 10\%) is a good starting point. Setting this
will remove variants that are present at a frequency greater than this value
at a given site.}

\item{regions}{"human", "mouse", or "custom". The argument refers to the
TS Mutagenesis panel of the specified species, or to a custom panel.
If custom, provide file path in custom_regions_file. TO DO: add rat.}

\item{custom_regions_file}{"filepath". If regions is set to custom,
provide the file path for the tab-delimited file containing regions metadata.
Required columns are "contig", "start", and "end".}

\item{rg_sep}{The delimiter for importing the custom_regions_file.
Default is tab-delimited.}

\item{depth_calc}{In the instance when there are two or more calls at the
same location within a sample, and the depths differ, this parameter chooses
the method of calculation for the total_depth. take_mean calculates the
total_depth by taking the mean reference depth and then adding all the alt depths.
take_del calculates the total_depth by choosing only the reference depth of
the deletion in the group, or if no deletion is present, the complex variant,
then adding all alt depths, if there is no deletion or complex variant,
then it takes the mean of the reference depths. Default is "take_del".
@param custom_column_names A list of names to specify the meaning of column
headers. Since column names can vary with data, this might be necessary to
digest the mutation data table properly. Typical defaults are set, but can
be substituted in the form of \code{list(total_depth = "my_custom_depth_name",  sample = "my_custom_sample_column_name")}. For a comprehensive list, see
examples. You can change one or more of these. The most likely column to
need changing is the "chromosome name" (contig), which by default is "seqnames"
but could be "contig", "chr", or others.  (TODO - MAKE EXAMPLES)}
}
\value{
A table where each row is a mutation, and columns indicate the location, type, and other data.
