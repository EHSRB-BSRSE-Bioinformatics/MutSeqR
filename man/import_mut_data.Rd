\arguments{
\item{mut_file}{The .mut file containing mutation data to be imported. If you
specify a folder, function will attempt to read all files in the folder and
combine them into a single data frame.
Columns required are: depth col = \code{total_depth} or \code{depth},
\code{alt_depth}, \code{context}, \code{ref}, \code{variation_type}, \code{contig}, \code{start}
(Synonymous names are accepted).}

\item{rsids}{\code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}; whether or not the .mut file contains rsID information
(existing SNPs).}

\item{sample_data_file}{An optional file containing additional sample metadata
(dose, timepoint, etc.).}

\item{sd_sep}{The delimiter for importing sample metadata table. Default is tab-delimited.}

\item{mut_sep}{The delimiter for importing the .mut file. Default is tab-delimited.}

\item{vaf_cutoff}{Add \code{is_germline} column that identifies ostensibly germline variants using
a cutoff for variant allele fraction (VAF). There is no default value provided,
but generally a value of 0.1 (i.e., 10\%) is a good starting point. Setting this
flag variants that are present at a frequency greater than this value
at a given site.}

\item{regions}{Values are \code{c("human", "mouse", "custom")}. Indicates the target panel used for Duplex Sequencing.
The argument refers to the TS Mutagenesis panel of the specified species, or to a custom panel.
If "custom", provide the file path of your regions file in \code{custom_regions_file}. TO DO: add rat.}

\item{custom_regions_file}{"filepath". If \code{regions} is set to "custom",
provide the file path for the file containing regions metadata.
Required columns are \code{contig}, \code{start}, and \code{end}.}

\item{rg_sep}{The delimiter for importing the \code{custom_regions_file}.
Default is tab-delimited.}

\item{depth_calc}{Values are \code{c("take_del", "take_mean")}. In the instance when
there are two or more calls at the same location within a sample, and the
depths differ, this parameter chooses the method for resolving the difference.
"take_mean" calculates the depth column by taking the mean of all depths in the group.
"take_del" calculates the depth column by choosing only the depth of
the deletion in the group, or if no deletion is present, the complex variant.
If there is no deletion or complex variant, then it takes the mean of the
depths within the group. Default is "take_del". depth_col = \code{total_depth} or \code{depth}.}

\item{custom_column_names}{A list of names to specify the meaning of column
headers. Since column names can vary with data, this might be necessary to
digest the mutation data table properly. Typical defaults are set, but can
be substituted in the form of \code{list(total_depth = "my_custom_depth_name",  sample = "my_custom_sample_column_name")}. For a comprehensive list, see
examples. You can change one or more of these.}

\item{output_granges}{\code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}; whether you want the mutation data to
output as a GRanges object. Default output is as a dataframe.}
}
\value{
A table where each row is a mutation, and columns indicate the location, type, and other data.
