\title{Compare the overall mutation spectra between groups}
\usage{
spectra_comparison(
  mf_data,
  muts = "dose_sum_unique",
  subtype_col = "normalized_subtype",
  group = c("dose", "tissue"),
  contrast_table_file,
  cont_sep = "\\t"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mf_data}{The data frame containing the mutation count data.
Mutation counts should be summarized per group for each mutation subtype of
interest. This data can be obtained using \code{calculate_mut_freq(summary=TRUE)}.}

\item{muts}{The column in mf_data containing the mutation count per group.}

\item{subtype_col}{The column in mf_data listing the mutation subtypes.}

\item{group}{A vector of grouping variables: this should be the groups
of interest across which you want to compare mutation spectra.
Ex. c("dose", "tissue")}

\item{contrast_table_file}{a filepath to a tab-delimited \code{.txt} file that
will specify the comparisons to be made between groups. The table must
consist of two columns. The first column will be a level within your group
column and the second column must be the group level that it will be
compared to. All values must correspond to entries in your \code{group}
column. For more than one \code{group} variable, separate the levels of the
each group with a colon. Ensure that all \code{groups} are represented in each
entry for the table. See details for examples.}

\item{cont_sep}{The delimiter used in the contrast_table_file.
Default is tab.}
}
\value{
the log-likelihood statistic G2 for the specified comparisons with
the p-value adjusted for multiple-comparisons.
}
\description{
spectra_comparison compares the mutation spectra of groups using a
modified contingency table approach.
}
\details{
Examples of \code{contrast_table_file}:
If you have \code{group = "dose"} with dose groups 0, 25, 50, 100. The first
column would contain the treated groups (25, 50, 100), while the second
column would be 0, thus comparing each treated group to the control group.

25 0

50 0

100 0

Ex. Consider two grouping variables \code{group = c("dose", "tissue")};
with levels dose (0, 25, 50, 100) and tissue("bone_marrow", "liver").
To compare the mutation spectra between tissues for each dose group,
the contrast table would look like:

0:bone_marrow	0:liver

25:bone_marrow	25:liver

50:bone_marrow	50:liver

100:bone_marrow 100:liver
}
