\usage{
spectra_comparison(
  mutation_data,
  cols_to_group,
  subtype_resolution = "base_6",

}
\arguments{
\item{mutation_data}{A data frame containing the mutation data. This
is the output from import_mut_data or import_vcf_data.}

\item{cols_to_group}{A character vector of the column names in the mutation
data that you want to group by. Ex. c("dose", "tissue"). This
function will sum the mutations across groups before running the comparison.}

\item{subtype_resolution}{The resolution of the mutation spectra to be
compared. Options include "base_6", "base_12", "base_96", and "base_192" and "type".
See calculate_mut_freq for more details.}

\item{variant_types}{A character vector of the mutation types to include
in the comparison. Default is all types of mutations.}

\item{mf_type}{The type of mutation frequency to use. Default is "min".}

\item{contrasts}{a filepath to a tab-delimited \code{.txt} file OR a dataframe that
will specify the comparisons to be made between groups. The table must
consist of two columns. The first column will be a level within your group
column and the second column must be the group level that it will be
compared to. All values must correspond to entries in your \code{cols_to_group}
column. For more than one \code{group} variable, separate the levels of
each group with a colon. Ensure that all \code{groups} listed in cols_to_group
are represented in each entry for the table. See details for examples.}

\item{cont_sep}{The delimiter used to import the contrasts table.
Default is tab.}
}
\value{
the log-likelihood statistic G2 for the specified comparisons with
the p-value adjusted for multiple-comparisons.
}
\description{
spectra_comparison compares the mutation spectra of groups using a
modified contingency table approach.
}
\details{
Examples of \code{contrasts}:
If you have \code{group = "dose"} with dose groups 0, 25, 50, 100. The first
column would contain the treated groups (25, 50, 100), while the second
column would be 0, thus comparing each treated group to the control group.

25 0

50 0

100 0

Ex. Consider two grouping variables \code{group = c("dose", "tissue")};
with levels dose (0, 25, 50, 100) and tissue("bone_marrow", "liver").
To compare the mutation spectra between tissues for each dose group,
the contrast table would look like:

0:bone_marrow	0:liver

25:bone_marrow	25:liver

50:bone_marrow	50:liver

100:bone_marrow 100:liver
}
