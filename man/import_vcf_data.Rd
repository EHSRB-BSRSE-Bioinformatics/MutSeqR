\arguments{
\item{vcf_file}{The path to the genomic .vcf file(s)  to be imported. If
you specify a folder, the function will attempt to read all files in the
folder and combine them into on dataset. Multisample vcf files are not
supported; vcf files must contain one sample each. Required fields are
listed below
\itemize{
\item FIXED FIELDS:
\item \code{CHROM}: The reference sequence name.Equivalent to \code{contig}
\item \code{POS}: 0-based start position of the feature in contig.
\item \code{REF}: The reference allele at this position
\item \code{ALT}: The left-aligned, normalized, alternate allele at this position.
\item FORMAT FIELDS:
\item \code{AD}: The allelic depths for the reference and alternate alleles in the
order listed.
\item \code{DP}: The total read depth at this position (including N-calls).
Equivalent to \code{depth}.
\item \code{VD}: Variant Depth. Equivalent to \code{alt_depth}.
\item INFO FIELDS
\item \code{TYPE}: The category to which this variant is assigned. Equivalent to
\code{variation_type}.
\item \code{END}: The half-open end position of the feature in contig.
\item SUGGESTED INFO FIELDS:
\item \code{sample}: An identifying field for your samples; either in the INFO
field or as the header to the FORMAT field.
\item \code{SVTYPE}: Structural variant types; INV DUP DEL INS FUS.
\item \code{SVLEN}: Length of the structural variant in base pairs.
}}

\item{vaf_cutoff}{Add \code{is_germline} column that identifies ostensibly
germline variants using a cutoff for variant allele fraction (VAF).
There is no default value provided, but generally a value of 0.01 - 0.1
(i.e., 1\% - 10\%) is a good starting point. Setting this
flag variants that are present at a frequency greater than this value
at a given site.}

\item{range_buffer}{An integer >= 0 .Required if using a targetted
approach.  Variants that occur outside of the defined regions' ranges
will be filtered out. Use the range-buffer to extend the range outside
of a region within which a variant can occur. The default is 1 nucleotide
outside of region ranges. Ex. Structural variants and indels may start
outside of the regions. Adjust the range_buffer to include these variants
in the final mutation data. Variants that are filtered out of the data
are returned in a separate dataframe.}

\item{sample_data_file}{An optional file containing additional sample
metadata (dose, timepoint, etc.)}

\item{sd_sep}{The delimiter for importing sample metadata tables.
Default is tab-delimited}

\item{regions}{"TSpanel_human", "TSpanel_mouse", "TSpanel_rat" ,
"custom_interval" or "none". The 'TSpanel_' argument refers to the TS
Mutagenesis panel of the specified species, or to a custom regions
interval file. If set to 'custom_interval', please provide the file path in
custom_regions_file and the genome assembly version of the reference
genome using the 'genome' parameter. If you are not using a targeted
approach, set regions to none, and supply the species and genome
assembly of the reference genome using the 'species' and 'genome'
parameters respectively.}

\item{custom_regions_file}{"filepath". If regions is set to custom_interval,
provide the file path for the file containing regions metadata.
Required columns are "contig", "start", and "end"}

\item{rg_sep}{The delimiter for importing the custom_regions_file.
Default is tab-delimited}

\item{genome}{The genome assembly of the reference genome. For a ########
complete list, refer to https://genome.ucsc.edu.
Ex.Human GRCh38 = hg38 | Human GRCh37 = hg19 | Mouse GRCm38 = mm10 |
Mouse GRCm39 = mm39 | Rat RGSC 6.0 = rn6 | Rat mRatBN7.2 = rn7}

\item{species}{The species of the reference genome. Required if
regions is set to none. The value can be the common name of the species
or the scientific name. Ex. "human" or "Homo sapiens".}

\item{depth_calc}{In the instance when there are two or more calls at the
same location within a sample, and the depths differ, this parameter chooses
the method of calculation for the total_depth. take_mean calculates the
total_depth by taking the mean reference depth and then adding all the alt
depths. take_del calculates the total_depth by choosing only the reference
depth of the deletion in the group, or if no deletion is present, the
complex variant, then adding all alt depths. If there is no deletion
or complex variant, it takes the mean of the reference depths.
Default is "take_del".}

\item{output_granges}{\code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}; whether you want the mutation
data to output as a GRanges object. Default output is as a dataframe.}
}
\value{
A data frame or a GRanges object where each row is a mutation,
and columns indicate the location, type, and other data.
}
\description{
The function reads the genomic vcf file(s) and extracts the
data into a dataframe. The function also reads in sample metadata
if provided and joins it with the mutation data. An interval list of genomic
regions can be provided to filter out variants that occur outside of the
defined regions' ranges. The function will use the reference genome to
extract the trinucleotide context of every position in the mutation data.
The function can output the mutation data as a dataframe or a granges
object.
