\usage{
signature_analysis_sigminer(
  mutations = mutation_data,
  project_name = "Default",
  project_genome = "BSgenome.Mmusculus.UCSC.hg38",
  group = "sample",
  run_bootstrapping = F,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{project_name}{The name of the project; used to get mutation data into the required .txt format for SigProfiler}

\item{project_genome}{A string describing the reference genome to use; e.g., GRCh38}

\item{group}{The column in the mutation data used to aggregate groups (e.g., sample ID, tissue, dose)}

\item{run_bootstrapping}{TRUE or FALSE. Default FALSE. Determines if the
sig_fit_bootstrap_batch() function should be run. This \emph{should} be done, but
the process is slow, so it's best to confirm that the rest of the analysis is
working as expected first.}

\item{mutation_data}{A data frame imported from a .mut file}
}
\value{
Creates a subfolder in the output directory with SigProfiler tools results.
}
\description{
After cleaning the mutation data input, runs several Alexandrov Lab tools for COSMIC signature analysis (assigns signatures to best explain the input data).
}
