\title{Get sequence of Duplex Sequencing target regions}
\usage{
get_region_seqs(species)
}
\arguments{
\item{species}{One of "mouse" or "human", to determine which regions to return.}
}
\value{
A GRanges object where each range is a target region.
}
\description{
This is mostly a helper function. It imports package data to find target
regions and some associated information, and further extends the table by
getting raw nucleotide sequences for each region of the genome. Note that the
way this is written, currently, the default genomes are hg38 and mm10 for
human and mouse, respectively.
