\title{Write FASTA file of reference sequences}
\usage{
write_VCF_from_mut(mutation_data, vcf_out = "./mutation_output.vcf")
}
\arguments{
\item{mutation_data}{A GRanges object imported from a .mut file}

\item{vcf_out}{The path for the VCF file output.}
}
\value{
Writes a VCF file of mutations to be used in downstream applications.
}
\description{
In some cases, you might want to generate an arbitrary multi-sequence FASTA
file from GRanges including the reference sequences. This function allows you
to do this.
