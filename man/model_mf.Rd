\arguments{
\item{mf_data}{The data frame containing the mutation frequency data.
Mutation counts and total sequencing depth should be summarized per sample
alongside columns for your fixed effects.
This data can be obtained using \code{calculate_mut_freq(summary=TRUE)}.}

\item{fixed_effects}{The name(s) of the column(s) that will act as the
fixed_effects (factor/independent variable) for modelling mutation frequency.}

\item{test_interaction}{a logical value. Whether or not your model should include
the interaction between the \code{fixed_effects}.}

\item{random_effects}{The name of the column(s) to be analysed as a
random effect in the model. Providing this effect will cause the function to
fit a generalized linear mixed-effects model.}

\item{reference_level}{Refers to one of the levels within each of your
fixed_effects. The coefficient for the reference level will represent the
baseline effect. The coefficients of the other levels will be interpreted in
relation to the reference_level as deviations from the baseline effect.}

\item{muts}{The column containing the mutation count per sample.}

\item{total_count}{The column containing the sequencing depth per sample.}

\item{family}{a description of the error distribution and link function to be
used in the model. The default is "quasibinomial" for generalized linear models
and "binomial" for generalized linear mixed-models. See \link[stats]{glm}
for more details.}

\item{contrasts}{a data frame or a  filepath to a file that will
provide the information necessary to make pairwise comparisons between groups.
The table must consist of two columns. The first column will be a group within
your fixed_effects and the second column must be the group that it will be
compared to.  The values must correspond to entries in your
mf_data column for each fixed effect. Put the group that you expect to have the higher
mutation frequency in the 1st column and the group that you expect to have a
lower mutation frequency in the second column. For multiple fixed effects,
separate the levels of each \code{fixed_effect} of a group with a colon. Ensure
that all \code{fixed_effects} are represented in each entry for the table.
See \code{details} for examples.}

\item{cont_sep}{The delimiter for importing the contrast table file. Default is tab-delimited.}

\item{...}{Extra arguments for \link[stats]{glm}  or \link[lme4]{glmer}. The
\code{glmer} function is used when a \code{random_effect} is supplied, otherwise, the
model uses the \code{glm} function.}
}
\value{
Model results are output as a list. Included are:
\itemize{
\item model_data: the supplied mf_data with added column for model residuals.
\item summary: the summary of the model.
\item anova: the analysis of variance for models with two or more effects. \link[car]{Anova}\code{(model) }
\item residuals_histogram: the model residuals plotted as a histogram. This is
used to check whether the variance is normally distributed. A symmetric
bell-shaped histogram, evenly distributed around zero indicates that the
normality assumption is likely to be true.
\item residuals_qq_plot: the model residuals plotted in a quantile-quantile plot.
For a normal distribution, we expect points to roughly follow the y=x line.
\item point_estimates_matrix: the contrast matrix used to generate point-estimates for the fixed effects.
\item point_estimates: the point estimates for the fixed effects.
\item pairwise_comparisons_matrix: the contrast matrix used to conduct the pairwise comparisons specified in the \code{contrasts}.
\item pairwise_comparisons: the results of pairwise comparisons specified in the \code{contrasts}.
}
}
\description{
\code{model_mf} will fit a linear model to analyse the effect(s) of given factor(s)
on mutation frequency and perform specified pairwise comparisons. This function
will fit either a generalized linear model (\link[stats]{glm}) or, if supplied
random effects, a generalized linear mixed-effects model (\link[lme4]{glmer}) .
Pairwise comparisons are conducted using the doBy library (\link[doBy]{esticon})
and estimates are then back-transformed. The delta method is  employed to
approximate the  back-transformed standard-errors. A Sidak  correction
is applied to adjust p-values for multiple comparisons.

\details{
\code{fixed_effects} are variables that have a direct and constant effect on the
dependent variable (ie mutation frequency).They are typically the experimental
factors or covariates of interest for their impact on the dependent variable.
One or more fixed_effect may be provided. If you are providing more than one
fixed effect, avoid using correlated variables; each fixed effect must
independently predict the dependent variable.
Ex. \code{fixed_effects = c("dose", "genomic_target", "tissue", "age", etc)}.

Interaction terms enable you to examine whether the relationship between the
dependent and independent variable changes based on the value of another
independent variable. In other words, if an interaction is significant, then
the relationship between the fixed effects is not constant across all levels
of each variable. Ex. Consider investigating the effect of dose group and tissue
on mutation frequency. An interaction between dose and tissue would capture
whether the dose response differs between tissues.

\code{random_effects} account for the unmeasured sources of statistical variance that
affect certain groups in the data. They help account for unobserved
heterogeneity or correlation within groups. Ex. If your model uses repeated
measures within a sample, \code{random_effects = "sample"}.

Setting a \code{reference_level} for your fixed effects enhances the interpretability
of the model. Ex. Consider a \code{fixed_effect} "dose" with levels 0, 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg.
Intuitively, the reference_level would refer to the  negative control dose, "0"
since we are interested in testing how the treatment might change mutation
frequency relative to the control.

Examples of \code{contrasts}:

If you have a \code{fixed_effect} "dose" with dose groups 0, 25, 50, 100,
then the first column would contain the treated groups (25, 50, 100), while
the second column would be 0, thus comparing each treated group to the control group.

25 0

50 0

100 0

Alternatively, if you would like to compare mutation frequency between treated
dose groups, then the contrast table would look as follows, with the lower
dose always in the second column, as we expect it to have a lower mutation
frequency. Keeping this format aids in interpretability of the estimates for
the pairwise comparisons. Should the columns be reversed, with the higher
group in the second column, then the model will compute the fold-decrease
instead of the fold-increase.

100 25

100 50

50 25

Ex. Consider the scenario where the \code{fixed_effects }
are "dose" (0, 25, 50, 100) and "genomic_target" ("chr1", "chr2"). To compare
the three treated dose groups to the control for each genomic target, the
contrast table would look like:

25:chr1	0:chr1

50:chr1	0:chr1

100:chr1	0:chr1

25:chr2	0:chr2

50:chr2	0:chr2

100:chr2	0:chr2

Troubleshooting: If you are having issues with convergence for your generalized linear mixed-
effects model, it may be advisable to increase the tolerance level for convergence
checking during model fitting. This is done through the \code{control} argument for
the \code{lme4::glmer} function. The default tolerance is tol = 0.002. Add this
argument as an extra argument in the \code{model_mf} function.
Ex. \code{control = lme4::glmerControl(check.conv.grad = lme4::.makeCC("warning", tol = 3e-3, relTol = NULL))}
}
