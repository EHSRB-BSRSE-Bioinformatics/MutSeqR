\usage{
glmm_mf(
  mf_data,
  fixed_effects = c("dose", "label"),
  test_interaction = TRUE,
  random_effects = "sample",

  muts = "sample_label_sum_unique",

}
\arguments{
\item{mf_data}{The data frame containing the mutation frequency data.
Mutation counts and total_depth should be summarized per sample alongside a
columns for your fixed effects.
This data can be obtained using the calculate_mut_freq(summary = TRUE).}

\item{fixed_effects}{This should be the name of the columns that will act as the
factor/fixed effect for modelling mutation frequency. Fixed effects encapsulate
the tendencies/trends that are consistent at the levels of primary interest.
These effects are considered fixed because they are non-random and assumed to
be constant for the samples being studied. Ex. 'fixed_effects = c("dose", "target")'.}

\item{test_interaction}{TRUE or FALSE. Whether or not your model should test
the interaction between fixed_effects on top of the effect of each factor.}

\item{random_effects}{This should be the name of the column to be analysed as
a random effect in the model. Random effects introduce statistical variability
at different levels of the data hierarchy. These account for the unmeasured
sources of variance that affect certain groups in the data. Ex. If your model
uses repeated measures of sample, 'random_effects = "sample"'.}

\item{reference_level}{Refers to one of the levels within your fixed_effects.
Remaining levels will be contrasted against the reference_level.
Ex. if my factor was a dose column, then my reference_level would refer to my
negative control dose.}

\item{muts}{The column containing the mutation count per sample.}

\item{total_count}{The column containing the sequencing depth per sample.}

\item{contrast_table_file}{a filepath to a tab-delimited .txt file that will
provide the information necessary to make comparisons between samples.
The first column must be a level within your factor and the second column
must be the level within your factor that it will be compared to. The names
must correspond to entries in your mf_data factor column. Put the factor that
you expect to have the higher mutation frequency in the 1st column and the
factor level that you expect to have a lower mutation frequency in the second
column. For example, if your factor is "dose" with dose groups 0, 25, 50, 100,
then the first column would contain the treated groups (25, 50, 100), while
the second column would be 0, thus comparing each treated group to the
control group. The contrast table for this example would be:

25 0

50 0

100 0

Alternatively, if you would like to compare mutation frequency between treated
dose groups, than the contrast table would look as follows, with the lower
dose always in the second column, as we expect it to have a lower mutation
frequency.

100 25

100 50

50 25}
