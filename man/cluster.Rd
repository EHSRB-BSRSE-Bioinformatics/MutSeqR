\usage{
cluster(
  mf_data = mf_data,
  sample_col = "sample",
  response_col = "norm_prop_unique",
  subtype_col = "normalized_subtype",
  dist = "cosine",
  cluster_method = "ward.D"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mf_data}{A data frame containing the mutation data. This data must
include a column containing the mutation subtypes, a column containing
the sample/cohort names, and a column containing the response variable.}

\item{sample_col}{The name of the column in data that contains the
sample/cohort names.}

\item{response_col}{The name of the column in data that contains the
response variable. Typical response variables can be the subtype frequency,
proportion, or count.}

\item{subtype_col}{The name of the column in data that contains the
mutation subtypes.}

\item{dist}{the distance measure to be used.
This must be one of "cosine", "euclidean", "maximum",
"manhattan","canberra", "binary" or "minkowski". See
\link[stats]{dist} for details.}

\item{cluster_method}{The agglomeration method to be used. See
\link[stats]{hclust} for details.}
}
\description{
perform hierarchical clustering of samples
based on the mutation spectra.
}
\details{
The cosine distance measure represents the inverted cosine
similarity between samples:
\eqn{\text{Cosine Dissimilarity} = 1 - \frac{\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B}}{\| \mathbf{A} \| \cdot \| \mathbf{B} \|}}
}
