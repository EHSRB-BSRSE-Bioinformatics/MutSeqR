\arguments{
\item{model}{A model object created using model_mf()}

\item{plot_type}{The type of plot to create. Options are "bar" or "point".}

\item{x_effect}{If there are multiple fixed effects in the model, specify
the fixed effect to plot on the x-axis. The other will be used in the fill
aesthetic. Currently, only 2 fixed effects are supported.}

\item{plot_error_bars}{Logical. If TRUE, the estimated standard error will
be added to the plot.}

\item{plot_signif}{Logical. If TRUE, will add significance labels based on
the pairwise_comparisons data frame in the model object. This is only valid
if you supplied a contrasts table to model_mf(). Symbols will be applied
to plotted values that are significantly different from the reference. Your
contrasts table is structured as a data frame with two columns, each
containing levels of the fixed effects to be contrasted. When adding
significance labels, symbols will be added to the values defined in the
first column, while the second column will represent the reference. A
different symbol will be used for each unique reference level. If a single
plotted value has been contrasted against multiple references, then it will
gain multiple symbols for each significance difference.}

\item{ref_effect}{The fixed effect to use as the reference level when adding
significance labels.}

\item{x_order}{A character vector indicating the order of the levels for the
x_effect.}

\item{fill_order}{A character vector indicating the order of the levels for
the fill aesthetic, if applicable.}

\item{x_label}{The label for the x-axis.}

\item{y_label}{The label for the y-axis.}

\item{plot_title}{The title of the plot.}

\item{fill_label}{The label for the fill aesthetic, if applicable.}

\item{custom_palette}{A vector of colors to use for the fill and color
aesthetics. If not provided, a default palette will be used. When plotting
a model that has a single fixed effect, you can specify colors for "fill" and
"color" using a named vector. Likewise, when plotting a model with two fixed
effects, you can specify colors for the levels within your fill variable.}
