\title{Get sequence of Duplex Sequencing target regions
To replace get_region_seqs.R for its relaince on importing the entire genomes
This will create a granges object from the target metadata and import raw nucleotide sequences from ensemble
Current defaults are GRCh38 and GRCm39 for human and mouse. Will add to specify genome
The code is functional, but inconsistent. It will work, but occasionally it will not be able to retrieve the sequences from ensembl
Perhaps an issue w network connectivity or the ensemble api server load}
\usage{
get_seq(species, regions_df)
}
\arguments{
\item{species}{"human" or "mouse"}

\item{regions_df}{data frame with columns: contig, start, and end}
}
\value{
a GRanges object with sequences and metadata
