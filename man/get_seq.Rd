\title{Get sequence of genomic target regions}
\usage{
get_seq(
  regions,
  rg_sep = "\\t",
  is_0_based_rg = TRUE,
  species = NULL,
  genome = NULL,
  masked = FALSE,
  padding = 0,
  ucsc = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{regions}{The regions metadata file to import. Can be either a file
path, a data frame, or a GRanges object. File paths will be read using
the rg_sep. Users can also choose from the built-in TwinStrand's Mutagenesis
Panels by inputting "TSpanel_human",  "TSpanel_mouse", or "TSpanel_rat".
Required columns for the regions file are "contig", "start", and "end".
In a GRanges object, the required columns are "seqnames", "start", and
"end".}

\item{rg_sep}{The delimiter for importing the regions file. The default is
tab-delimited ("\t").}

\item{is_0_based_rg}{A logical variable. Indicates whether the position
coordinates in \code{regions} are 0 based (TRUE) or 1 based (FALSE).
If TRUE, positions will be converted to 1-based (start + 1). Need not be
supplied for TSpanels. Default is TRUE.}

\item{species}{The species for which to retrieve the sequences.
Species may be given as the scientific name or the common name.
Ex. "Human", "Homo sapien". Used to choose the appropriate
BS genome. Need not be supplied for TSpanels.}

\item{genome}{The genome assembly version for which to retrieve the
sequences. Used to choose the appropriate genome (BS genome or UCSC).
Ex. hg38, hg19, mm10, mm39, rn6, rn7. Need not be supplied for TSpanels.}

\item{masked}{A logical value indicating whether to use the masked version
of the BS genome when retrieving sequences. Default is FALSE.}

\item{padding}{An integer value by which the function will extend the range
of the target sequence on both sides. Start and end coordinates will be
adjusted accordingly. Default is 0.}

\item{ucsc}{A logical value. If TRUE, the function will retrieve the
sequences from the UCSC genome browser using an API. If FALSE, the function
will retrieve sequences using the appropriate BSgenome package, which will
be installed as needed. Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
a GRanges object with sequences of targeted regions.
}
\description{
Create a GRanges object from the genomic target ranges and import raw
nucleotide sequences.
}
\details{
Consult
\code{available.genomes(splitNameParts=FALSE, type=getOption("pkgType"))}
for a full list of the available BS genomes and their associated
species/genome/masked values. The BSgenome package will be installed if
not already available. If using the UCSC API, the function will retrieve
the sequences from the UCSC genome browser using the DAS API. See the
UCSC website for available genomes: \url{https://genome.ucsc.edu}.
