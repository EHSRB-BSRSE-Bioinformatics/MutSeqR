\arguments{
\item{mf_data}{A data frame containing the dose-response data. Data may
be individual for each sample or averaged over dose groups.
Required columns for individual data are the column containing the dose
\code{dose_col} and the column(s) containing the mutation frequency data
\code{response_col}(s). Summary data must include the \code{dose_col}, the
\code{response_col}(s) containing the mean response for each dose group,
the \code{sd_col} containing the standard deviation of the response data,
and the \code{n_col} containing the sample size for each dose group.}

\item{data_type}{A string specifying the type of response data.
Data may be response per individual or summarised across dose groups.
Options are ("individual", "summary"). Default is "individual".}

\item{dose_col}{The column in mf_data containing the dose data. Default is
"dose".}

\item{response_col}{The column(s) in mf_data containing the mutation
frequency data. For summarised data types, this should be the mean response
for each dose group. Multiple \code{response_col}s can be provided.}

\item{sd_col}{The column in mf_data containing the standard deviation of
the summarised response data. This is only required for
\code{data_type = "summary"}. If multiple response columns are provided,
multiple \code{sd_col}s should be provided in the same order. Default is NULL.}

\item{n_col}{The column in mf_data containing the sample size of each dose
group. This is only required for \code{data_type = "summary"}. If multiple
response columns are provided, multiple \code{n_col}s should be provided in the
same order. Default is NULL.}

\item{bmr_type}{The type of benchmark response. Options are: "rel", "sd",
"hybrid", "abs". Default is "rel". See details for more information.}

\item{bmr}{A numeric value specifying the benchmark response. The bmr is
defined in relation to the calculation requested in bmr_type. Default is 0.5.}

\item{model}{The model type to use. Options are "all" or
a vector of model types. Default is "exp-aerts", the Exponential model.
See details for available models. Note that model averaging will use
a pre-defined model set. See details for more information.}

\item{alpha}{The specified nominal coverage rate for computation of
the lower and upper confidence intervals for the benchmark dose
(BMDL, BMDU). The confidence level is calculated as
\eqn{100\times(1-2\alpha)\% }. The default is 0.05 (90\% CI).}

\item{model_averaging}{A logical value indicating whether to use model
averaging. Default is TRUE (recommended).}

\item{plot_results}{A logical value indicating whether to plot the BMD models
and/or the Cleveland plots. Default is FALSE. If TRUE, the function will
save plots to the \code{output_path}.}

\item{ma_summary}{A logical value indicating whether to return the summary
of the model averaging results. Default is FALSE.}

\item{output_path}{The file path indicating where to save the plots.
If NULL, the plots will be saved to the working directory. Default is NULL.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed to the model fitting function.
For more information, see \link[ToxicR]{single_continuous_fit} or
\link[ToxicR]{ma_continuous_fit} if model averaging.}
}
\value{
If \code{model_averaging = FALSE}, the function returns a data frame
with the BMD values and the \eqn{100\times(1-2\alpha)\% } confidence
intervals (BMDL, BMDU)for each response column and each model listed. The
AIC value is calculated for each model to compare fits. The AIC is
calculated as maximum likelihood + 2 * degrees of freedom. If
\code{plot_results = TRUE}, the function will plot all fitted models to the
data and save them to the \code{output_path}.

If \code{model_averaging = TRUE}, the function returns a data frame with the
BMD values and the \eqn{100\times(1-2\alpha)\% } confidence intervals
(BMDL, BMDU) for each response column calculated using model averaging.
If \code{ma_summary = TRUE}, the function will return the posterior probabilities
used in the model averaging. If \code{plot_results = TRUE}, the function will plot
the model averaged model to the data and save it to the \code{output_path}.
The function will also make a Cleveland plot, saved to the  \code{output_path}.
Here, the BMDs are plotted for each model in the set alongside the model
averaged BMD. The BMD is represented by a red dot. The size of the dot is
scaled on the model probability with the Model Average having a value of
100\%. The BMDL and BMDU are expressed as interval bars.

dose-response of mutation frequency using the ToxicR software.

\details{
Available model types for single model fitting are:
\itemize{
\item \code{"exp-aerts"}: \eqn{f(x) = a(1 + (c-1)(1-\exp(-bx^{d}))) }
\item \code{"invexp-aerts"}: \eqn{f(x) = a(1 + (c-1)(\exp(-bx^{-d})))}
\item \code{"gamma-aerts"}: \eqn{f(x) = a(1 + (c-1)(Gamma(bx^d;xi)))}
\item \code{"invgamma-aerts"}:
\eqn{f(x) = a(1 + (c-1)(1-Gamma(bx^{-d};xi)))}
\item \code{"hill-aerts"}:
\eqn{f(x) = a(1 + (c-1)(1-\frac{b^d}{b^d + x^d}))}
\item \code{"lomax-aerts"}:
\eqn{f(x) = a\left\{1 + (c-1)(1-\left(\frac{b}{b+x^d} \right)^\xi) \right\}}
\item \code{"invlomax-aerts"}:
\eqn{f(x) = a\left\{1 + (c-1)(\left(\frac{b}{b+x^{-d}} \right))^\xi \right\}}
\item \code{"lognormal-aerts"}:
\eqn{f(x) = a\left\{1 + (c-1)\left(\Phi( \ln(b) + d\times \ln(x))\right) \right\}}
\item \code{"logskew-aerts"}:
\eqn{f(x) = a\left\{1 + (c-1)\left(\Phi_{SN}( \ln(b) + d\times \ln(x); \xi )\right) \right\}}
\item \code{"invlogskew-aerts"}:
\eqn{f(x) = a\left\{1 + (c-1)\left(1 - \Phi_{SN}( \ln(b) - d\times \ln(x); \xi )\right) \right\}}
\item \code{"logistic-aerts"}:
\eqn{f(x) = \frac{c}{1 + \exp(-a - b\times x^d)} }
\item \code{"probit-aerts"}:
\eqn{f(x) = c\left(\Phi(a + b\times x^d)\right) }
\item \code{"LMS"}: \eqn{f(x) = a(1 + (c-1)(1 - \exp(-bx - dx^2)))}
\item \code{"gamma-efsa"}: \eqn{f(x) = a(1 + (c-1)(Gamma(bx; d)))}
}
Here: \eqn{\Phi(\cdot)} is the standard normal distribution and
\eqn{\Phi_{SN}(\cdot;\cdot)} is the skew-normal distribution.
See \link[ToxicR]{single_continuous_fit} for more details.

Model averaging is done over the the model set described in The European
Food Safety Authority's (2022) Guidance on the use of the benchmark dose
approach in risk assessment. These models are (normal then lognormal for
each model): exp-aerts, invexp-aerts, hill-aerts, lognormal-aerts,
gamma-efsa, LMS, probit-aerts, and logistic-aerts. See
\link[ToxicR]{ma_continuous_fit} for more details.

BMR types for continuous models:
\itemize{
\item Relative deviation (default; \code{bmr_type = "rel"}). This defines the
BMD as the dose that changes the control mean/median a certain
percentage from the background dose. It is the dose that
solves \eqn{\mid f(dose) - f(0) \mid = (1 \pm BMR) f(0)}
\item Standard deviation (\code{bmr_type = "sd"}). This defines the BMD as
the dose associated with the mean/median changing a specified number of
standard deviations from the mean at the control dose. It is the
dose that solves \eqn{\mid f(dose)-f(0) \mid = BMR \times \sigma}
\item Absolute deviation (\code{bmr_type="abs"}). This defines the BMD
as an absolute change from the control dose of zero by a specified amount.
That is the BMD is the dose that solves the equation
\eqn{\mid f(dose) - f(0) \mid = BMR}.
\item Hybrid deviation (\code{bmr_type = "hybrid"}). This defines the
BMD that changes the probability of an adverse event by a stated amount
relative to no exposure (i.e 0).  That is, it is the dose that solves
\eqn{\frac{Pr(X > x| dose) - Pr(X >x|0)}{Pr(X < x|0)} = BMR}.
For this definition,
\eqn{Pr(X < x|0) = 1 - Pr(X > X|0) = \pi_0}, where \eqn{0 \leq \pi_0 < 1}
is defined by the user as "point_p," and it defaults to 0.01.  Note: this
discussion assumed increasing data. The fitter determines the direction
of the data and inverts the probability statements for decreasing data.
