plot_mean_mf(
  mf_data,
  group_col = "dose",
  mf_type = "both",
  plot_type = "line",
  plot_error_bars = TRUE,
  plot_indiv_vals = TRUE,

\arguments{
\item{mf_data}{A data frame containing the mutation frequency data. This is
obtained from the calculate_mut_freq function with SUMMARY = TRUE.}

\item{group_col}{The column in mf_data by which to calculate the mean.
Ex. "dose" or c("dose", "tissue").}

\item{mf_type}{The type of mutation frequency to plot. Options are "min",
"max", "both", or "stacked". If "both", the min and max mutation
frequencies are plotted side by side. "stacked" can be chosen for bar
plot_type only. If "stacked", the difference between the min and max
MF is stacked on top of the min MF such that the total height of both
bars represent the max MF. Default is "min".}

\item{plot_type}{The type of plot to create. Options are "bar" or "line".
Default is "bar".}

\item{plot_error_bars}{Whether to plot the error bars. Default is TRUE.
Error bars are standard error of the mean.}

\item{plot_indiv_vals}{Whether to plot the individual values as data points.
Default is FALSE.}

\item{group_order}{The order of the groups along the x-axis.
' Options include:
\itemize{
\item \code{none}: No ordering is performed. Default.
\item \code{smart}: Groups are ordered based on the sample names.
\item \code{arranged}: Groups are ordered based on one or more factor column(s)
in mf_data. Factor column names are passed to the function using the
\code{group_order_input}.
\item \code{custom}: Groups are ordered based on a custom vector of group
names. The custom vector is passed to the function using the
\code{group_order_input}.
}}

\item{group_order_input}{The order of the groups if group_order is
"custom". The column name by which to arrange groups if group_order
is "arranged".}

\item{add_labels}{The data labels to display on the plot. Either
"indiv_count", "indiv_MF", "mean_count", "mean_MF", or "none".
Count labels display the number of mutations, MF labels display the mutation
frequency. Mean plots the mean value. Indiv plots the labels for individual
data points (only if plot_indiv_vals = TRUE). Default is "none".}

\item{scale_y_axis}{The scale of the y axis. Either "linear" or "log".
Default is "linear".}

\item{plot_title}{The title of the plot. Default is
"Mean Mutation Frequency".}

\item{custom_palette}{A custom color palette to use for the plot. Values that
can be customized include "Mean", "Individual", "Mean min", "Mean max",
"Individual min", and "Individual max". Default is NULL.
@return a ggplot object}

\item{xlab}{The x-axis label. Default is the value of group_col.}

\item{ylab}{The y-axis label. Default is "Mutation Frequency (mutations/bp)".}
}
\description{
This function calculates the mean mutation frequency across
samples for given groups and plots the results.
