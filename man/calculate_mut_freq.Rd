calculate_mut_freq(
  data,
  cols_to_group = "sample",
  subtype_resolution = "6base",
  vaf_cutoff = 0.1,
  clonality_cutoff = 0.3,

}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The data frame to be processed containing mutation data.}

\item{cols_to_group}{A vector of grouping variables: this should be the groups
of interest that you want to calculate a frequency for. For instance, getting
the frequency by \code{sample}. Other options might include \code{locus}, or,
\code{c("sample","locus")}. Must be a column in the mutation data table.}

\item{subtype_resolution}{At what resolution should the frequencies be
calculated? This is an important consideration because the reference bases
sequencing depth will differ depending on which mutation subtypes are being
considered. Options are "none", 6base", "12base", "96base", and "192base".
Could add 24 base option eventually. By selecting "none", this will use the
total depth across all the selected metadata columns.}

\item{vaf_cutoff}{Exclude rows from frequency calculations
with a variant allele fraction (VAF) greater than this value. Default is 0.1.}

\item{clonality_cutoff}{NOT CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED! Up for consideration.
This value determines the fraction of reads that
is considered a constitutional variant. If a mutation is present at a
fraction higher than this value, the reference base will be swapped,
and the alt_depth recalculated. 0.3 (30\%) would be a sane default?}

\item{summary}{TRUE or FALSE, whether to return a summary table (i.e., where
only relevant columns for frequencies and groupings are returned). Setting
this to false returns all columns in the original data, which might make
plotting more difficult, but may provide additional flexibility to power
users.}

\item{variant_types}{Include these variant types. A vector of one or more
"snv", "indel", "sv", "mnv", "no_variant"}

\item{custom_column_names}{A list of names to specify the meaning of column
headers. Since column names can vary with data, this might be necessary to
digest the mutation data table properly. Typical defaults are set, but can
be substituted in the form of \code{list(total_depth = "my_custom_depth_name",  sample = "my_custom_sample_column_name")}. For a comprehensive list, see
examples. You can change one or more of these. The most likely column to
need changing is the "chromosome name" (chr), which by default is "seqnames"
but could be "contig", "chr", or others.  (TODO - MAKE EXAMPLES)}
}
\value{
A data frame with the mutation frequency calculated.
}
\description{
Calculates the mutation frequency for arbitrary groupings and creates a new
dataframe with the results. Mutation frequency is # mutations / total bases,
but this can be subset in different ways: e.g., by mutation context. In this
case, it is necessary to change the denominator of total bases to reflect
the sequencing depth at the proper reference bases under consideration.
}
\details{
Additionally, the operation is run by default using clonally expanded as well
as unique mutations.
