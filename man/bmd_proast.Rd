\item{dose_col}{The name of the column in mf_data that contains the dose.
Must be a numeric value.}

mutation frequency. Ex. \code{c("sample_MF_min", "sample_MF_max")}.}

continuous data is defined as a \link{CES}-percent change in mean response

standard deviation should be used as the CES.}

model averaging. Default is 200.}

should be returned. If FALSE, raw results from the PROAST analysis are

displayed in the R plot viewer.}

\item{output_type}{svg or none. If svg, the plots will be saved as .svg files
in the output_path. If none, the plots will NOT be saved, but be displayed in
plot viewer.}

If summary is TRUE, a data frame of final results. If summary is
FALSE, a list of the raw results from the PROAST analysis.

\description{
Calculate the BMD of continuous, individual-level data.
This function is an extension of the PROAST software (copyright RIVM
National Institute for Public Health and the Environment).
}
\details{
This function is a  modified version of the original interactive
PROAST software (\url{https://www.rivm.nl/en/proast} that allows for batch
processing of data. The function is designed to be used with the output of
the \code{calculate_mf} function for the purpose of calculating the
Benchmark Dose of mutation frequency data. As such, some functionality of
the original PROAST software has been removed.

This function will accept continuous data, with an observation for each
individual subject. It is assumed that data are lognormally distributed.
The response data is log-transformed, then back-transformed after the
statistical analysis. The function will fit model 3 or 5 from various
families of models (Exponential, Hill, Inverse Exponential, LogNormal).
It will then compare the fits of models 3 and 5 for each model family and
select the model with the lowest AIC. The BMD 90\% confidence intervals will
be calculated based on the selected model (3 or 5) for each model family
using the profile likelihood method. The BMD 90\% confidence interval may
also be calculated using the bootstrap method if
\code{model_averaging = TRUE}. It is recommended to use 200 bootstraps for
model averaging.

The function gives you the option to return either a summary of the results
or the raw results output from the PROAST analysis. The summary will include
the following for each response variable and covariate subgroup (if
applicable):
\itemize{
\item \code{Selected.Model}: The m3 or m5 model selected for each model family
(Exponential, Hill, Inverse Exponential, LogNormal).
\item \code{Response}: The response variable.
\item \code{Covariate}: The covariate subgroup, if applicable.
\item \code{CES}: The critical effect size of the Benchmark Response.
\item \code{CED}: The Benchmark Dose, in original dose units, estimated for
the given model.
\item \code{CEDL}: The lower bound of the 90\% confidence interval for the BMD,
calculated by the profile likelihood method.
\item \code{CEDU}: The upper bound of the 90\% confidence interval for the BMD,
calculated by the profile likelihood method.
\item \code{AIC}: The Akaike Information Criterion for the selected model.
Lower values indicate a better fit. It is advised to choose the BMD value
from the model with the lowest AIC.
\item \code{Log.Likelihood}: the log-likelihood of the given model.
\item \code{Var}: The residual variance around the fitted curve on the
natural log-scale.
\item \code{a}: Model Parameter - the background response
\item \code{d}: Model Parameter - the slope of the curve.
\item \code{weights}: The weight of the model in the model averaging process,
if applicable.
}
If there is no significant response in the data, the function will return an
empty data frame.

If \code{plot_results = TRUE} the function will create the following plots
for each response variable:
\itemize{
\item Expon. The fitted curve of the selected (3 or 5) exponential model.
Data is log-transformed. Individual data points are plotted using small
triangles. The geometric mean (median) at each dose is plotted as a large
triangle. The BMD is indicated by the dotted line. If applicable, the
covariate subgroup is indicated by color.
\item Hill. The fitted curve of the selected (3 or 5) Hill model.
Data is log-transformed. Individual data points are plotted using small
triangles. The geometric mean (median) at each dose is plotted as a large
triangle. The BMD is indicated by the dotted line. If applicable, the
covariate subgroup is indicated by color.
\item InvExpon. The fitted curve of the selected (3 or 5) Inverse-exponential model.
Data is log-transformed. Individual data points are plotted using small
triangles. The geometric mean (median) at each dose is plotted as a large
triangle. The BMD is indicated by the dotted line. If applicable, the
covariate subgroup is indicated by color.
\item LN. The fitted curve of the selected (3 or 5) LogNormal model.
Data is log-transformed. Individual data points are plotted using small
triangles. The geometric mean (median) at each dose is plotted as a large
triangle. The BMD is indicated by the dotted line. If applicable, the
covariate subgroup is indicated by color.
\item ma.plot for \code{model_averaging = TRUE} The bootstrap curves based
on model averaging. The geometric mean (median) at each dose is plotted as
a large triangle. Data is log-transformed.
\item cleveland plot for \code{model_averaging = TRUE} The BMD estimate
for each model is plotted with error bars representing the 90\% confidence
interval. The size of the point represents the model weight.
