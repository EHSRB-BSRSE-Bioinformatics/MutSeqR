\title{Annotate CpG sites}
\usage{
annotate_CpG_sites(mut_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{mut_data}{A GRanges object containing the genomic regions of interest in which to look for CpG sites. Must have the metadata column "sequence" populated with the raw nucleotide sequence to search for CpGs.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the same number of rows as there were ranges in the input, but with an additional metadata column indicating CpG sites in the target sequence of the mutation.
}
\description{
A simple method to test whether your trinucleotide context contains a CpG site. Vectorized version of Biostrings::vcountPattern is used.
