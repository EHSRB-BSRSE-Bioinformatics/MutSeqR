\usage{
signature_decomposition(
  mutations = mutation_data,
  project_name = "Default",
  project_genome = "GRCh38",
  group = "sample",
  python_path = "~/../../AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python310/python.exe",
  python_home = "~/.virtualenvs/r-reticulate"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{project_name}{The name of the project; used to get mutation data into the required .txt format for SigProfiler}

\item{project_genome}{A string describing the reference genome to use; e.g., GRCh38}

\item{group}{The column in the mutation data used to aggregate groups (e.g., sample ID, tissue, dose)}

\item{python_path}{The path to the version of python to be used with reticulate. It is important that this version of python meets the dependecies, including the SigProfiler python tools.}

\item{mutation_data}{A data frame imported from a .mut file}

\item{output_path}{The directory where output results should be written}
}
\value{
Creates a subfolder in the output directory with SigProfiler tools results.
}
\description{
After cleaning the mutation data input, runs several Alexandrov Lab tools for COSMIC signature analysis (assigns signatures to best explain the input data).
