plot_trinucleotide(
  mutation_data,
  response = c("frequency", "proportion", "sum"),
  mf_type = "unique",

  max_y = c("individual", "group"),

}
\arguments{
\item{mutation_data}{A data frame containing mutation data. This can be obtained
using the 'import_mut_data' or 'read_vcf' functions.}

\item{response}{A character string specifying the type of response to plot.
Must be one of 'frequency', 'proportion', or 'sum'.}

\item{mf_type}{A character string specifying the mutation count method to
plot. Must be one of 'unique' or 'clonal'. Default is 'unique'.}

\item{group_col}{A character string specifying the column(s) in 'mutation_data'
to group the data by. Default is 'sample'. The sum, proportion, or frequency
will be calculated and a plot will be generated for all unique levels of this
group. You can specify more than one column to group by.}

\item{max_y}{A character string specifying the max response value for the y-axis.
Must be one of 'individual' or 'group'.'individual' will adjust the maximum y-axis
value for each level of the group independently of the others. 'group' will set the
maximum y-axis value based on the entire dataset such that all plots will have the
same scale. Default is 'group'.}

\item{output_path}{A character string specifying the path to save the output plot.
Default is NULL. This will create an output directory in the current working
directory.}

\item{output_type}{A character string specifying the type of output file.
Options are  'jpeg', 'pdf', 'png', 'svg', or 'tiff'. Default is 'svg'.}

\description{
Creates barplots of the trinucleotide spectrum for all levels of
a given group based on the mutation data. All plots are exported.
}
\details{
The function calculates the mutation frequency and plots the trinucleotide
spectrum for all levels of a given group based on the mutation data.
The function calculates the mutation frequency using the 'calculate_mut_freq'
function with "cols_to_group" set to 'group_col' and "subtype_resolution" set
to 'base_96'. For a given group, mutation counts and total informative duplex
bases are summed across all samples. Mutation frequency is calculated by
dividing the total mutation counts by the total number of duplex bases.
For a given mutation subtype, proportion is calculated as the proportion
of total mutation counts normalized to the total number of duplex bases
for a given group and subtype.
^ should just explain this in calculate mutation freq and refer to that function.
