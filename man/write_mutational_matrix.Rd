\title{Write a Mutational Matrix to input into the sigprofiler web application}
\usage{
write_mutational_matrix(
  mutation_data,
  group = "dose",
  matrices = "base_96",
  mf_type = "min",
  filter = "somatic",
  output_path = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mutation_data}{The GRanges object containing the mutation data.
The output of import_mut_data() or read_vcf().}

\item{group}{The column in the mutation data used to aggregate groups
(e.g., sample, tissue, dose)}

\item{matrices}{At what resolution should the snv mutation counts be
calculated? Options are "base_96", 1536?, 384?, 6144?, DINUC? 6, 24, INDEL
TO DO: add more matrices options.}

\item{mf_type}{Mutation counting method. Options are "min" or "max".
Minimum Independent Frequency (min): All identical mutations within a
sample are assumed to be the result of clonal expansion and are thus
only counted once. Maximum Independent Frequency (max): All identical
mutations within a sample are assumed to be idenpendant mutational evens
and are included in the mutation frequency calculation. Note that this
does not apply for germline variants. Default is "min".
TO DO: clonality cut_off?}

\item{filter}{Parameter allows you to choose to filter for only somatic
or germline mutations.}

\item{output_path}{The path to save the output file. Default is NULL,
which will save the file in the current working directory.
Values = c("somatic", "germline", "none). "none" will leave the data unfiltered.}
}
\value{
a .txt file that can be uploaded to the sigprofiler web application
as "Mutational Matrix"
}
\description{
Creates a .txt file from mutation data that can be used for mutational signatures
analysis using the SigProfiler web application. Can handle group analyses
(ex dose, tissue, etc). Currently only supports snv.
