\title{Write a Mutational Matrix to input into the sigprofiler web application}
\usage{
write_mutational_matrix(
  mutations,
  group = "dose",
  matrices = "base_96",
  include_clonal = FALSE,
  filter = "somatic"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mutations}{The GRanges object containing the mutation data.
The output of import_mut_data() or read_vcf().}

\item{group}{The column in the mutation data used to aggregate groups
(e.g., sample, tissue, dose)}

\item{matrices}{At what resolution should the snv mutation counts be
calculated? Options are "base_96", 1536?, 384?, 6144?, DINUC? 6, 24, INDEL
TO DO: add more matrices options.}

\item{include_clonal}{Should the mutational matrix include possibly clonally expanded mutations.
If FALSE, any mutation occuring more than once in a single sample will only be counted once.
TO DO: clonality cut_off?}

\item{filter}{Parameter allows you to choose to filter for only somatic or germline mutations.
Values = c("somatic", "germline", "none). "none" will leave the data unfiltered.
#' @returns a .txt file that can be uploaded to the sigprofiler web application as "Mutational Matrix"}
}
\description{
Creates a .txt file from mutation data that can be used for mutational signatures
analysis using the SigProfiler web application. Can handle group analyses
(ex dose, tissue, etc). Currently only supports snv.
