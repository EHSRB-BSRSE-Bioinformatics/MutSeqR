\title{Get the coordinates of the CpG sites within your genomic regions}
\usage{
get_CpG_regions(regions, motif = "CG")
}
\arguments{
\item{regions}{A GRanges object containing the genomic regions of interest in
which to look for CpG sites. Must have the metadata column "sequence" populated
with the raw nucleotide sequence to search for CpGs. This object can be
obtained using the get_seq.R function.}

\item{motif}{Default "CG", which returns CpG sites. You could in theory use
an arbitrary string to look at different motifs. Use with caution.}
}
\value{
A GRanges object where each range is a CpG site (a subset of ranges
from the larger object provided to the function).
}
\description{
Filters the ranges of your genomic regions to find a positions with a
specific motif. The default is CpG sites, but can be customizable.
