\arguments{
\item{mutation_data}{A data frame, imported from a .mut file}

\item{project_name}{The name of the project; used to get mutation data into the required .txt format for SigProfiler}

\item{project_genome}{A string describing the reference genome to use;
e.g. GRCh37, GRCH38, mm10, mm9, rn6
output_path The directory where output results should be written. *not a parameter of the function}

\item{env_name}{The name of the virtual environment. This will be created on first use.}

\item{group}{The column in the mutation data used to aggregate groups (e.g., sample ID, tissue, dose)}

\item{output_path}{The filepath to thedirectory in which the output folder will be created to store results.}

\item{python_version}{The version of python to be used.}

\item{python_path}{The path to the version of python to be used with reticulate. It is important that this version of python meets the dependencies, including the SigProfiler python tools.}

\item{python_home}{The path to the conda virtual environment that contains the required python dependencies}
}
\value{
Creates a subfolder in the output directory with SigProfiler tools results.

\description{
After cleaning the mutation data input, runs several Alexandrov Lab tools for COSMIC signature analysis (assigns signatures to best explain the input data).
