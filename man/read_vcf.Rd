\usage{
read_vcf(
  vcf_file,
  sample_data_file = NULL,
  sd_sep = "\\t",
  regions_file = c("human", "mouse", "custom"),
  custom_regions_file = NULL

}
\arguments{
\item{vcf_file}{The .vcf file containing mutation data to be imported.}

\item{sample_data_file}{An optional file containing additional sample metadata (dose, timepoint, etc.)}

\item{sd_sep}{The delimiter for importing sample metadata tables}

\item{regions_file}{"human", "mouse", or "custom". The argument refers to the TS Mutagenesis panel of the specified species, or to a custom panel. If custom, provide file path in custom_regions_file. TO DO: add rat.}

\item{custom_regions_file}{"filepath". If regions_file is set to custom, provide the file path for the tab-delimited file containing regions metadata. Required columns are "contig", "start", and "end"}

A table where each row is a mutation, and columns indicate the location, type, and other data.

\description{

TO DO: vcf files need to first be modified because they contain different column names...
The last column name is the sample name. This must be removed in order to bind them all together.
