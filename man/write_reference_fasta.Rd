\title{Write FASTA file of reference sequences}
\usage{
write_reference_fasta(ref_ranges, fasta_out = "./reference_output.fasta")
}
\arguments{
\item{ref_ranges}{A GRanges object including the sequences of the reference
regions included for the data.}

\item{fasta_out}{The path for the FASTA file output.}
}
\value{
Writes a FASTA reference file to be used in downstream applications.
}
\description{
In some cases, you might want to generate an arbitrary multi-sequence FASTA
file from GRanges including the reference sequences. This function allows you
to do this.
