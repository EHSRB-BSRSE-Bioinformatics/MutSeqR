\format{
A vector with corresponding values
}
\usage{
denominator_dict
}
\description{
These values are used to cross reference base substitution types to their
appropriate denominators for calculations. That is, for example, the 6 base
substitution frequency should be subsetted based on the normalized_ref
column which would contain only T or C (i.e., the pyrimidine context for
base substitutions).
