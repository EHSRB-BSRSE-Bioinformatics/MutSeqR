\usage{
write_mutation_calling_file(
  mutations,
  project_name = "test",
  project_genome = "GRCm38"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mutations}{The GRanges object containing the mutation data.
The output of import_mut_data() or read_vcf().}

\item{project_name}{The name of the project; used to get mutation data
into the required .txt format for SigProfiler}

\item{project_genome}{A string describing the reference genome to use
(e.g., GRCh38, GRCm38)
See import_mut_data() or read_vcf() for more details.}
}
\value{
a .txt file that can be uploaded to the sigprofiler web application
as "Mutational calling file"
Filters out ostensibly germline mutations identified in mutaiton data..
}
\description{
Creates a .txt file from mutation data that can be used for mutational signatures
analysis using the SigProfiler web application.Cannot group higher than sample.
