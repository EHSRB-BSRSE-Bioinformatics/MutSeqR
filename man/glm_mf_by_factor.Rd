\usage{
glm_mf_by_factor(
  mf_data,
  factor = "dose",
  reference_level = 0,
  muts = "sample_sum_unique",
  total_count = "sample_group_depth",
  contrast_table = rbind(c(6.25, 0), c(12.5, 0), c(25, 0), c(12.5, 6.25), c(25, 6.25),
    c(25, 12.5))
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mf_data}{The data frame containing the mutation frequency data.
Mutation counts and total_depth should be summarized per sample alongside a
column for your factor of interest.
This data can be obtained using the calculate_mut_freq(summary = TRUE).}

\item{factor}{This should be the name of the column that will act as the
factor for modelling mutation frequency. Only one factor can be analysed within
the general linear model. Ex. "dose", or "time_point".}

\item{reference_level}{Refers to one of the levels within your factor.
Remaining levels will be contrasted against the reference_level.
Ex. if my factor was a dose column, then my reference_level would refer to my
negative control dose.}

\item{muts}{The column containing the mutation count per sample.}

\item{total_count}{The column containing the sequencing depth per sample.}

\item{contrast_table}{a .txt file that will provide the information necessary
to make comparisons between samples. The first column must be a level within
your factor and the second column must be the level within your factor that
it will be compared to. The names must correspond to entries in your mf_data
factor column. Put the factor that you expect to have the higher mutation
frequency in the 1st column and the factor level that you expect to have a
lower mutation frequency in the second column. For example, if your factor
is "dose" with dose groups 0, 25, 50, 100, then the first column would
contain the treated groups (25, 50, 100), while the second column would be 0,
thus comparing each treated group to the control group.
The contrast table for this example would be:

25 0

50 0

100 0

Alternatively, if you would like to compare mutation frequency between treated
dose groups, than the contrast table would look as follows, with the lower
dose always in the second column.

100 25

100 50

50 25}
