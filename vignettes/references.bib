	abstract = {Error-corrected Next Generation Sequencing (ecNGS) is rapidly emerging as a valuable, highly sensitive and accurate method for detecting and characterizing mutations in any cell type, tissue or organism from which DNA can be isolated. Recent mutagenicity and carcinogenicity studies have used ecNGS to quantify drug-/chemical-induced mutations and mutational spectra associated with cancer risk. ecNGS has potential applications in genotoxicity assessment as a new readout for traditional models, for mutagenesis studies in 3D organotypic cultures, and for detecting off-target effects of gene editing tools. Additionally, early data suggest that ecNGS can measure clonal expansion of mutations as a mechanism-agnostic early marker of carcinogenic potential and can evaluate mutational load directly in human biomonitoring studies. In this review, we discuss promising applications, challenges, limitations, and key data initiatives needed to enable regulatory testing and adoption of ecNGS - including for advancing safety assessment, augmenting weight-of-evidence for mutagenicity and carcinogenicity mechanisms, identifying early biomarkers of cancer risk, and managing human health risk from chemical exposures.},

	abstract = {Mutations, the irreversible changes in an organism’s DNA sequence, are present in tissues at a variant allele frequency (VAF) ranging from ∼10-8 per bp for a founder mutation to ∼10-3 for a histologically normal tissue sample containing several independent clones – compared to 1\%− 50\% for a heterozygous tumor mutation or a polymorphism. The rarity of these events poses a challenge for accurate clinical diagnosis and prognosis, toxicology, and discovering new disease etiologies. Standard Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies report VAFs as low as 0.5\% per nt, but reliably observing rarer precursor events requires additional sophistication to measure ultralow-frequency mutations. We detail the challenge; define terms used to characterize the results, which vary between laboratories and sometimes conflict between biologists and bioinformaticists; and describe recent innovations to improve standard NGS methodologies including: single-strand consensus sequence methods such as Safe-SeqS and SiMSen-Seq; tandem-strand consensus sequence methods such as o2n-Seq and SMM-Seq; and ultrasensitive parent-strand consensus sequence methods such as DuplexSeq, PacBio HiFi, SinoDuplex, OPUSeq, EcoSeq, BotSeqS, Hawk-Seq, NanoSeq, SaferSeq, and CODEC. Practical applications are also noted. Several methods quantify VAF down to 10-5 at a nt and mutation frequency (MF) in a target region down to 10-7 per nt. By expanding to {\textgreater} 1 Mb of sites never observed twice, thus forgoing VAF, other methods quantify MF {\textless} 10-9 per nt or {\textless} 15 errors per haploid genome. Clonal expansion cannot be directly distinguished from independent mutations by sequencing, so it is essential for a paper to report whether its MF counted only different mutations – the minimum independent-mutation frequency MFminI – or all mutations observed including recurrences – the larger maximum independent-mutation frequency MFmaxI which may reflect clonal expansion. Ultrasensitive methods reveal that, without their use, even mutations with VAF 0.5–1\% are usually spurious.},

	abstract = {Mutagenicity testing is an essential component of health safety assessment. Duplex Sequencing (DS), an emerging high-accuracy DNA sequencing technology, may provide substantial advantages over conventional mutagenicity assays. DS could be used to eliminate reliance on standalone reporter assays and provide mechanistic information alongside mutation frequency (MF) data. However, the performance of DS must be thoroughly assessed before it can be routinely implemented for standard testing. We used DS to study spontaneous and procarbazine (PRC)-induced mutations in the bone marrow (BM) of MutaMouse males across a panel of 20 diverse genomic targets. Mice were exposed to 0, 6.25, 12.5, or 25 mg/kg-bw/day for 28 days by oral gavage and BM sampled 42 days post-exposure. Results were compared with those obtained using the conventional lacZ viral plaque assay on the same samples. DS detected significant increases in mutation frequencies and changes to mutation spectra at all PRC doses. Low intra-group variability within DS samples allowed for detection of increases at lower doses than the lacZ assay. While the lacZ assay initially yielded a higher fold-change in mutant frequency than DS, inclusion of clonal mutations in DS mutation frequencies reduced this discrepancy. Power analyses suggested that three animals per dose group and 500 million duplex base pairs per sample is sufficient to detect a 1.5-fold increase in mutations with {\textgreater} 80\% power. Overall, we demonstrate several advantages of DS over classical mutagenicity assays and provide data to support efforts to identify optimal study designs for the application of DS as a regulatory test.},

DS revealed a linear dose-related induction of mutations across all targets with low intra-group variability. Heterochromatic and intergenic regions exhibited the highest mutation frequencies (MF). C:G {\textgreater} A:T transversions at CCA, CCC and GCC trinucleotides were enriched in BaP-exposed mice consistent with the known etiology of BaP mutagenesis.

This article introduces a novel approach that addresses many of the challenges seen while providing a fully Bayesian framework. Furthermore, in contrast to methods that use Monte Carlo Markov Chain, we approximate the posterior density using maximum a posteriori estimation. The approximation allows for an accurate and reproducible estimate while maintaining the speed of maximum likelihood, which is crucial in many applications such as processing massive high throughput data sets. We assess this method by applying it to empirical laboratory dose-response data and measuring the coverage of confidence limits for the BMD. We compare the coverage of this method to that of other approaches using the same set of models. Through the simulation study, the method is shown to be markedly superior to the traditional approach of selecting a single preferred model (e.g., from the U.S. EPA BMD software) for the analysis of dichotomous data and is comparable or superior to the other approaches.},

	abstract = {The Scientific Committee (SC) reconfirms that the benchmark dose (BMD) approach is a scientifically more advanced method compared to the no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) approach for deriving a Reference Point (RP). The major change compared to the previous Guidance (EFSA SC, 2017) concerns the Section 2.5, in which a change from the frequentist to the Bayesian paradigm is recommended. In the former, uncertainty about the unknown parameters is measured by confidence and significance levels, interpreted and calibrated under hypothetical repetition, while probability distributions are attached to the unknown parameters in the Bayesian approach, and the notion of probability is extended to reflect uncertainty of knowledge. In addition, the Bayesian approach can mimic a learning process and reflects the accumulation of knowledge over time. Model averaging is again recommended as the preferred method for estimating the BMD and calculating its credible interval. The set of default models to be used for BMD analysis has been reviewed and amended so that there is now a single set of models for quantal and continuous data. The flow chart guiding the reader step-by-step when performing a BMD analysis has also been updated, and a chapter comparing the frequentist to the Bayesian paradigm inserted. Also, when using Bayesian BMD modelling, the lower bound (BMDL) is to be considered as potential RP, and the upper bound (BMDU) is needed for establishing the BMDU/BMDL ratio reflecting the uncertainty in the BMD estimate. This updated guidance does not call for a general re-evaluation of previous assessments where the NOAEL approach or the BMD approach as described in the 2009 or 2017 Guidance was used, in particular when the exposure is clearly lower (e.g. more than one order of magnitude) than the health-based guidance value. Finally, the SC firmly reiterates to reconsider test guidelines given the wide application of the BMD approach.},

Though numerous studies exist for Model Average BMD estimation using dichotomous responses, fewer studies investigate it for BMD estimation using continuous response. In this setting, model averaging a BMD poses additional problems as the assumed distribution is essential to many BMD definitions, and distributional uncertainty is underestimated when one error distribution is chosen a priori. As model averaging combines full models, there is no reason one cannot include multiple error distributions. Consequently, we define a continuous model averaging approach over distributional models and show that it is superior to single distribution model averaging.

              Motivation
              Analysis of mutational signatures is a powerful approach for understanding the mutagenic processes that have shaped the evolution of a cancer genome. To evaluate the mutational signatures operative in a cancer genome, one first needs to quantify their activities by estimating the number of mutations imprinted by each signature.
            
            
              Results
              Here we present SigProfilerAssignment, a desktop and an online computational framework for assigning all types of mutational signatures to individual samples. SigProfilerAssignment is the first tool that allows both analysis of copy-number signatures and probabilistic assignment of signatures to individual somatic mutations. As its computational engine, the tool uses a custom implementation of the forward stagewise algorithm for sparse regression and nonnegative least squares for numerical optimization. Analysis of 2700 synthetic cancer genomes with and without noise demonstrates that SigProfilerAssignment outperforms four commonly used approaches for assigning mutational signatures.

	abstract = {The screen‐and‐bin approach for interpretation of genotoxicity data is predicated on three false assumptions: that genotoxicants are rare, that genotoxicity dose–response functions do not contain a low‐dose region mechanistically characterized by zero‐order kinetics, and that genotoxicity is not a
              bona fide
              toxicological endpoint. Consequently, there is a need to develop and implement quantitative methods to interpret genotoxicity dose–response data for risk assessment and regulatory decision‐making. Standardized methods to analyze dose–response data, and determine point‐of‐departure (PoD) metrics, have been established; the most robust PoD is the benchmark dose (BMD). However, there are no standards for regulatory interpretation of mutagenicity BMDs. Although 5–10\% is often used as a critical effect size (CES) for BMD determination, values for genotoxicity endpoints have not been established. The use of BMDs to determine health‐based guidance values (HBGVs) requires assessment factors (AFs) to account for interspecies differences and variability in human sensitivity. Default AFs used for other endpoints may not be appropriate for interpretation of
              in vivo
              mutagenicity BMDs. Analyses of published dose–response data showing the effects of compensatory pathway deficiency indicate that AFs for sensitivity differences should be in the range of 2–20. Additional analyses indicate that the AF to compensate for short treatment durations should be in the range of 5–15. Future work should use available data to empirically determine endpoint‐specific CES values; similarly, to determine AF values for BMD adjustment. Future work should also evaluate the ability to use
              in vitro
              dose–response data for risk assessment, and the utility of probabilistic methods for determination of mutagenicity HBGVs. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 61:66–83, 2020. © 2019 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada},

            In studies examining the patterns or spectra of mutational damage, the primary variables of interest are expressed typically as discrete counts within defined categories of damage. Various statistical methods can be applied to test for heterogeneity among the observed spectra of different classes, treatment groups and/or doses of a mutagen. These are described and compared via computer simulations to determine which are most appropriate for practical use in the evaluation of spectral data. Our results suggest that selected, simple modifications of the usual Pearson X2 statistic for contingency tables provide stable false positive error rates near the usual alpha = 0.05 level and also acceptable sensitivity to detect differences among spectra. Extensions to the problem of identifying individual differences within and among mutant spectra are noted.},
